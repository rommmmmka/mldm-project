# Project report

In this project I am going to recreate the neural network from the article called
["LightSleepNet: Design of a Personalized Portable Sleep Staging System Based on Single-Channel EEG"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13194v1)
and evaluate it's performance on public sleep dataset.

In the original article the model was evaluated using ["Sleep-EDF"](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edf/1.0.0/) dataset and only one (Fpz-Cz) EEG channel.

I'm going to perform my experiments on another dataset called ["ISRUC-Sleep"](https://sleeptight.isr.uc.pt) on 6 different EEG channels:
F3-A2, C3-A2, O1-A2, F4-A1, C4-A1 and O2-A1.

## What have I already done
